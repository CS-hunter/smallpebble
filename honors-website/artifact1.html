      <h1>Autmn Quarter Reflection</h1>
      <p>&emsp; My goals remain the same as they were at the beginning
        of the quarter, only slightly tempered. The biggest
        change has been obtaining a better understanding on the
        difficulty level of college coursework. With my better
        understanding of workload for classes, my schedule next
        quarter looks much more reasonable. It will give me time
        to work more during winter quarter (the busiest time of
        the year for a tire salesman), and maybe even open some
        free time to pursue an independent computer science
        project. My grades will likely benefit as well, since I
        am taking less STEM classes, less credits, and
        synchronous classes - instead of my completely
        asynchronous online Math 124 class (which keeps me up at
        night). Another consequence of poor planning is my
        absence in Elm floor 6 activities, since I’m always
        doing computer science instead of playing spike ball.
        COVID, obviously, has not helped with this. I have made
        a few friends, however, and they hold similar interests
        to me, likely because we are all in the Honors program.
        The people here I can honestly say I would like to be
        friends with for a long time, because out of all the
        places I’ve made friends, here are the most motivated,
        smart, funny, and caring people I have met. They are
        not only friends, but people I respect. </p>
      <p>&emsp; Beyond social-life we have the academic.
        And sometimes I focus too heavily on this part
        (at least that’s what my mom keeps telling me).
        I would really like to be involved with some
        sort of research next year, and I am putting my
        best foot forward to make that happen. I find
        machine learning and artificial intelligence
        particularly fascinating, and I know there are
        many research projects happening in these fields.
        I have already reached out to TAs and PhD students
        to see if I could be involved but unfortunately, I
        got shut down. They told me to take the Machine
        Learning course at UW, which is a capacity
        constrained upper level CSE course. And since I did
        not get admitted into the school of computer
        science, I essentially have no hope of taking that class.
        In my rejection email from the PhD student he gave an
        alternate solution. If I had a strong enough background
        without the class- that is through projects and a
        portfolio I built for myself outside of UW, I may
        be considered for research opportunities. This was
        my Dumb and Dumber “So what are my chances?” moment,
        where I continue forward with blind optimism. I will
        still try and apply to the CS program, although my
        grades suck and I already got rejected through
        direct admission. I still have a chance to improve
        my grades in calculus or by taking CSE143 again, but
        all things considered: this pathway looks unlikely to
        be a realistic possibility. I will settle for applied
        maths if I can manage to pass the calc series and get
        in. Otherwise I’ll probably drop out and learn at my
        own rate. </p>
        <p>&emsp; I have learned most this quarter through failure.
        These lessons have been difficult, but I am beginning
        to think aphorism ‘builds character’ might have some
        truth to it. Successive failures have helped me realize
        that I do not have control over the outcome, but I do
        have control over my actions. So when reality arrives
        in its unpleasant manner, I will do nothing but smile
        and keep moving forward.</p>
